# Level 0: Learn to Code Python
An absolute beginner's first time lesson to learn how to code.

## What does it mean to code?
When you write code, you are using a programming language to instruct the computer how to perform different tasks like add numbers together, display a webpage, or store information into a database.  You can use programming languages like Python by writing these instructions to a file inside of a special developer's program that looks a lot like Microsoft Word (but for code).  When run a program, the computer translates the programming language into something it can understand how to follow.  The computer follows the program, and returns a result.

## What is Python?
No, its not the snake!  Python is a powerful programming language that is used in many businesses and industries.  It is also one of the easier languages to learn.  With a few lines of code, you can reach the internet, perform complex mathematics, rearrange and manipulate data, and connect to databases.

## Why should I learn?
Learning to code is valuable and fun!
* Its valuable because you learn a new skill that can have a dramatic influence on the way that you solve problems and do work!
* Its fun because writing code can be challenging and rewarding. You feel a sense of accomplishment when your program works!
